This is a Full-Stack MERN-Based Application that allows you to Submit your Videos to the Public so that they can Watch, Review them and even support your Channel.  This app was based off of the concept of YouTube, but made in my own way in order to Provide to the public.  You can Upload Videos, Subscribe to Channels, Like or Dislike Videos, Comment on Videos, etc!  Have fun and enjoy what you can do.
